        <p> 
            I was born in Hong Kong, China, and grew up both in China and in the United States. Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree at Tufts University. Why Computer Science? If you asked me 4 years ago, I would never have been able to tell you, because I knew nothing about it. Since then, I have discovered a passion for a subject that both challenges me and makes me proud of what I create on a daily basis. </p>

            Music and creativity are also very important in my life. This penchant for creativity is ultimately what drew me to programming. Writing good, logical code, at its core, is its own art form.
